      <description>My study, Private Copying in Croatia, argues for an overhaul of the Croatian private copying remuneration scheme and gives some empirical evidence for the transposition of the DSM Directive. Even for those who are not interested in royalties, the first 3 chapters offer a very interesting introduction on how people listen to music, how musicians make music and how people copy it in the 21st century.</description>

      <title>DSM Directive, Value Gap &amp; Private Copying Levies</title>

      <description>We see common threats and common opportunities with the national implementations of the DSM Directive.  While it is not addressing private copying, it is aiming to re-arrange the power balance between users and rightsholders of certain unlicensed, or not fully-licensed and compensated uses. Users will use this opportunity to keep as much as possible from the value transfer to their media platforms, and hardware manufacturers will try to freeze very low private copying remuneration levels in the region. Or worse still: to reduce them.</description>
