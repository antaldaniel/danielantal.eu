      <description>My open source program code was released within the 3.6.1 version of eurostat R package, making the painful boundary alignment with frequent region border changes, and resulting data imputation work automatic and less error-prone. As a result, more and more of my work, and particularly the music indicators of CEEMID are becoming available on provincial/regional level.</description>

      <description>A Progress Report on the Czech Music Development Program and problems in an international context. We would like to invite any Czech stakeholders, or even individuals to join our Research Consortium, because in the music sector, all organization are microenterprise or small enterprise sized, they usually have no significant market research, innovation and strategic HR management capacities.

      <description>My study, Private Copying in Croatia, argues for an overhaul of the Croatian private copying remuneration scheme and gives some empirical evidence for the transposition of the DSM Directive. Even for those who are not interested in royalties, the first 3 chapters offer a very interesting introduction on how people listen to music, how musicians make music and how people copy it in the 21st century.</description>
