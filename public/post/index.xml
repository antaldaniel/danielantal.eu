      <description>Total national sales reflect the growing number of subscribers, the price, the exchange rate, and many factors that are not important for an artists or music label. Instead we design indexes that show the real growth for a typical domestic or foreign rightsholder in a country.  The aim is to provide useful sales and performance guidance for smaller countries, genres and exporting destinations.</description>

      <title>Musicians’ Living Standards And Life Satisfaction In The CEE Region</title>
      <link>/post/life_sat_19/</link>

      <description>Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.  However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.</description>

      <title>DSM Directive, Value Gap &amp; Private Copying Levies</title>
      <link>/post/dsm_pcr_19/</link>

      <description>We see common threats and common opportunities with the national implementations of the DSM Directive.  While it is not addressing private copying, it is aiming to re-arrange the power balance between users and rightsholders of certain unlicensed, or not fully-licensed and compensated uses. Users will use this opportunity to keep as much as possible from the value transfer to their media platforms, and hardware manufacturers will try to freeze very low private copying remuneration levels in the region. Or worse still: to reduce them.</description>

      <description>Since most music professional work in microenterprises, or as freelancers, they usually do not participate in economic statistical surveys, and their problems remain hidden from government officials and the general public. This is why we designed an developed an individual-level survey since 2014 which in 2019 already covers more than 10 countries.</description>
