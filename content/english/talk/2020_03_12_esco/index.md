I will be participating in the __ESCO Focus group on Cultural and Creative Occupations and Skills__ of the [Creative FLIP](https://creativeflip.creativehubs.net/) project. 

CEEMID has a large enough answer pool for an empirical clustering of occupations. We are able to perform clustering of job descriptions, earnings, educational levels, and work output (such as films, documentaries, TV programmes, live music performances, music compositions, etc) to empirically create groups with a “set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterised by a high degree of similarity” in terms of economic activity and work output. Further details in the [blog post here](/post/2020-03-11-esco/).
